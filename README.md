# Predictive_Analysis_on_Spotify_Song_List
Engineered a Predictive Analysis Model on Spotify song list dataset to understand the song preference of the users for improving the user experience in Python.

This project practices data predictive analytics on a Spotify song dataset with the aim of classifying and predicting the users song choice on Spotify, a widely popular music 
application on mobile. The dataset is about a song list in 2017, which is retrieved from Spotify's API through Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification. 

It consists of 16 columns and more than 2000 rows. In which, 3 columns store the information of songs such as Name, Artist, and Label, and the remaining 13 columns 
are songs' attributes like Acousticness, Duration, Energy, Tempo, etc. The label for the songs are given by the column name “Target”, which is our predictive target, telling us about the likes 
and dislikes about the song represented as 1 and 0 respectively.
